### Usage
This script allows you to interact with email logs, view, search, and process them using a command-line interface (CLI). On running the script, you will be prompted to enter your username and password for authentication. After logging in, you will see a menu with four options. The four options are as follows:
- **Command 1:** This allows the user to view the email logs
- **Command 2:** This allows the user to search through the email logs.
This would then ask the user for 8 different options. 1 is to search for a specific string.
2 is to search for a specific date. 3 is to search for a keyword in the email's subject.
4 is to search for the sender's email address. 5 is to search for the receiver's email address. 6 is to search for a type of email that fails the check e.g. phishing or spam. 7 is to search for an action status such as blocked or allowed. And lastly, 8 returns back to the homepage.
- **Command 3:** This allows the user to see the processed emails by name.
- **Command 4:** This allows the user to exit the program.



### Note - To All - From Tamara
You need to set up a .env if u want it to work

## New note - To All - From Tamara
You need to also add in a password for .env. I added a random password 'test'. It uses that to validate whatever the users input into the prompt. If correct they will proceed else try again.

### What needs to be done
1. Integrate peoples code within mine - I will help for that
2. I need to remove some of my test comments later
3. I need to move around some print statements for it a better
